                    I've always loved the idea of having <span class="light-emphasis">"themes"</span> to represent a period of one's life. A sentence or paragraph that encapsulates the
                    directions and philosophical underpinning of a given period. The shorter the better.

                    This page is a collection of the evolving themes that have shaped my personal and professional work over time.
                    Each tagline represents a distinct period in my journey, reflecting my focus and aspirations of that moment.

                        <p>
                            I adopted this theme around the same time I started to work fulltime on <a href="https://eidon.ai" target="_blank">Eidon AI</a></span>. This has been recurrent in the discussions
                            with the team about the future of AI and, at large, the future of humanity: The future is what <span class="emphasis">we</span> make of it. It will be whatever <span class="emphasis">we</span>
                            wanted to be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is not at a personal level. This is not about I want to own X or make Y or live in Z. This is about us all as humans. How humanity will look like
                            in 1,000 years, 2,000, 100,000 or more is up to <span class="emphasis">us</span>. For me, that future is fantastic. And it is what I am working for at <a href="https://eidon.ai" target="_blank">Eidon AI</a></span>.

                <div class="theme-item">
                    <p class="theme-title">"Deep, sincere, first-principle thinking. Succinct, original, independent writing"</p>
                    <p class="theme-period">Jan 2024</p>
                    <div class="theme-description">
                        <p>
                            I have not been as consistent of a writer as I would like. My writing has gone through ebbs and flows, often inversely proportional to how much I am reading at any point in time.
                            As they say <span class="light-emphasis">"when you are overthinking, write; when you are underthinking, read"</span>. But anytime I go back to a writing phase, I try to take this
                            theme as my guiding principle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I am to produce something worth reading - if I am to be let into someone else's mind - then my thinking must be deep, sincere, and principled. Only then will valubale writing come out
                            the other end.

                <div class="theme-item">
                    <p class="theme-title">"As if it were the last thing I do in life"</p>
                    <p class="theme-period">Apr 2023</p>

                            During my annual re-read of meditations in 2023, I was fundamentally shaken by <a href="https://stoicbreviary.blogspot.com/2018/03/marcus-aurelius-meditations-25.html" target="_blank"> Meditations 2.5</a>.
                            It forced me to reflect on the million distractions I was succumbing to on a daily basis in both professional and personal life. Going through life as a slave to distraction and impulses.
                            Shortly after, that quote was <a href="https://medium.com/themeditations/as-if-it-were-the-last-thing-i-do-in-life-cfd66e2dbe7a" target="_blank">tattooed in my arm</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This continues to be a daily reminder, strategically placed on my forearm, of the beauty that comes from doing things with devotion and concentration.
